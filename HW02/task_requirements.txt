ДЗ 2. Experiments with minimization

Plot loss function value (should drop over the fitting, loss = f(epoch))
Try RMSE, MAE and maybe other losses for linear regression
Make animation for fitting: plots of changing fitting curve (line) over the data (see slides)
Experiment with non-linear data, for example:
y = 2 * x**2 + x + 3.5 + noise
Experiment with number of samples, sigma, and optimization algorithms
